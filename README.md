Coding assessment for Flogistix

Upon launching the application, you will be greeted with a Home and Favorites screen. On the home screen, there will be a search bar at the top where you can search meteors by name or id.

To add a favorite meteor, press the favorites button and the selected meteor will be added to your favorites. 

The rendering of favorites page is still a WIP, the data will persist due to firebase integration and will console log out the favorited meteor.
